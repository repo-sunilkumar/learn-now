&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;b style=&quot;font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: Arial, Verdana;&quot;&gt;Finalize:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: Arial, Verdana;&quot;&gt; Used to free unmanaged resources like files, database connections, COM etc. held by an object before that object is destroyed. Internally, it is called by Garbage Collector and cannot be called by user code. It belongs to Object class. Implement it when you have unmanaged resources in your code, and want to make sure that these resources are freed when the Garbage collection happens. There is performance costs associated with Finalize method&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial, Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.3333px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Arial, Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.3333px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dispose:&lt;/b&gt; It is used to free unmanaged resources like files, database connections, COM etc. at any time. Explicitly, it is called by user code and the class implementing dispose method must implement IDisposable interface. It belongs to IDisposable interface. Implement this when you are writing a custom class that will be used by other users. There is no performance costs associated with Dispose method.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
